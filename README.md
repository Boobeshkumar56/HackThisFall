Online Tendering DApp (Python Backend with Streamlit Interface)
Overview
This Online Tendering DApp is a decentralized application designed for managing tenders and bids using Ethereum smart contracts. The frontend is powered by Streamlit, while the backend is handled using Flask (Python). Users can interact with the blockchain via MetaMask, and the application features real-time tender creation, bid submission, and contract awarding.

Setting Up and Running the DApp
1. Install Dependencies
1.pip install streamlit
2.pip install web3

3. Running the Application
To start your application:

Start the Streamlit Interface:

Open a terminal and navigate to the frontend directory:

bash
Copy code
cd frontend\app
streamlit run main.py
run the index.html using live server and connect the metamask wallet

This will open the Streamlit UI in your browser where users can interact with the application.
3. Interacting with the DApp
Tender Creation: Users can create new tenders via the UI and interact with the Ethereum smart contract to deploy them on the blockchain.
Bidding: Users can place bids on active tenders using their connected MetaMask accounts.
Viewing Tender Details: Users can click on a specific tender to view more information about the tender and its current status.
Tender and Bid Data: Tender and bid information is stored in the tenders_data.json and bids.json files for testing purposes, and could be replaced with a database in a production version.

Technologies Used
Frontend: Streamlit (for building UI), MetaMask (for Ethereum interaction)
Backend: Flask (for server-side logic, interacting with smart contracts)
Blockchain: Ethereum (smart contracts written in Solidity, interacted with using web3.py)
MetaMask: For secure wallet management and signing Ethereum transactions
Conclusion
By following these steps, you'll be able to run and interact with your Online Tendering DApp. Make sure to test MetaMask connectivity, the bid creation, and tender management features on your local setup first, before deploying to a live environment.
